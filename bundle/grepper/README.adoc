== Intro

This plugin is a convenience wrapper around `'grepprg'` and `'grepformat'`,
supports most common grep tools, and is easily extendable.

You choose a tool, enter a search term, and get your matches into a quickfix
list.

If you use Neovim the search will be executed asynchronously. Thus you will be
able to continue editing while the grep program is still running.

Supports by default: *git grep*, *ag*, *pt*, *ack*, *grep*, *findstr*

I wrote up a little link:https://github.com/mhinz/vim-grepper/wiki[step-by-step guide in the wiki].

== Mappings

There are no pre-defined mappings, but 3 `<plug>` mappings that should be used:

    nmap <leader>g <plug>(Grepper)
    xmap <leader>g <plug>(Grepper)
    cmap <leader>g <plug>(GrepperNext)
    nmap gs        <plug>(GrepperMotion)
    xmap gs        <plug>(GrepperMotion)

Now, `<leader>g` in normal mode will prompt for a new search term and in visual
mode will adopt the current visual selection.

If you're at the search prompt, `<leader>g` will switch to the next grep tool.

`gs` is an operator and takes any motion, e.g. `gsi(` or `gsap`.

Use `<up>` and `<down>` for going through the input history or use `<c-f>` to
open it in the cmdwin.

TIP: Read `:h grepper` for the whole truth.

== Installation and Documentation

If you don't have a plugin manager, I suggest having a look at
link:https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.git[vim-plug]. Installation is a
breeze afterwards:

    Plug 'mhinz/vim-grepper'

Restart Vim or `:source $MYVIMRC`, then do `:PlugInstall`.
